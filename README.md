# Bookshelfd

This project is the front end of the bookshelfd application. Bookshelfd is designed to allow users to search for books using the Google books API, and to then add these books to their own personal reading lists by saving them to a database.

The project was created using Angular, using bootstrap for some quick and dirty styling
